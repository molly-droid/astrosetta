# Project Status & Sequence

Living tracker for the Base44 → Supabase/Vercel/Capacitor migration.
Update this file as items move. Cutover mechanics live in
[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md); the parity protocol in
[NAVIGATOR_PARITY_TEST.md](./NAVIGATOR_PARITY_TEST.md).

_Last updated: 2026-09-24_

## Done

- [x] Web app imported from Base44 export; standalone Vite build; Base44 SDK
      replaced by the Supabase shim (103 feature files untouched)
- [x] Replica schema (from `base44/entities/*.jsonc`) + compat RPC applied to
      Molly's project (`sqdpawyqvgqadflezxxk`)
- [x] All 34 backend functions ported to Edge Functions and deployed; scheduled
      workflows → pg_cron; entity automations → DB triggers
- [x] `/login` page (replaces Base44 hosted login); e2e smoke drives
- [x] Data import + media re-hosting **scripts** written (execution happens at
      cutover, not before)
- [x] Deployment & cutover runbook
- [x] Capacitor iOS/Android scaffolded
- [x] **Client InvokeLLM → 37 named server-side tasks** (`llm-task` function,
      tier gates, daily quotas, usage logging) — smoke-tested 7/7 locally
- [x] Navigator parity test: protocol, harness, and the frozen Claude baseline
      transcript (`scripts/navigator-parity/results/`)
- [x] Mobile groundwork (no accounts needed): native runtime plugins wired
      (status bar, splash, keyboard, back nav), `astrosetta://` deep links on
      both platforms incl. Supabase auth callback handling, safe-area shell,
      RevenueCat SDK staged behind a flag — iOS simulator + Android debug
      builds verified compiling (see docs/MOBILE.md)
- [x] Local dev sandbox proven (ports 5434x; Tony's Anthropic key local-only)

## In progress / partially unblocked

- [x] **Pushed to GitHub and merged to `main`** (2026-09-25) — `main` is now
      the trunk; work continues there. Go-live remains gated by the cutover
      steps (data import + DNS), not by the merge.
- [ ] Resend: key received → set as hosted secret; domain DNS verification
      still needed before real sends
- [ ] Google OAuth: client created by Molly → client ID/secret still need to
      go into Supabase Auth (+ redirect URI in Google console)
- [ ] Stripe: awaiting team invite (then we self-serve: products/prices,
      restricted key, webhook, subscriber export)
- [ ] Astrology-API.io: Molly generating key (backend-only restriction)

## Remaining work, in order

**Phase 1 — parallel, no dependencies (now):**
1. ~~Mobile groundwork needing no accounts~~ done (see above); an on-device
   polish pass (safe areas/status bar/keyboard on real hardware) remains
2. Wire Google OAuth into Supabase Auth (when creds arrive) — also add
   `astrosetta://login` to the Auth redirect allowlist for native
3. Stripe setup once team invite lands (products, webhook → secrets)
4. Molly sign-off: AI daily limits + tier-gate map (proposal in DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Phase 2 — Astrology-API.io (when key arrives):**
5. Implement provider in `navigator-chat` `generateReply()` behind
   `NAVIGATOR_PROVIDER`; run parity test; score vs baseline → go/no-go
6. Implement chart engine behind the existing adapter (replacing the ported
   hand-rolled ephemeris); validate against `packages/core` / cross-check
   function. (Full recalc of cached charts happens at cutover regardless.)

**Phase 3 — subscriptions:**
7. RevenueCat project + entitlements; Stripe/Apple/Google products mapped;
   webhooks, restore, reconciliation (needs Apple/Play/RevenueCat accounts +
   Apple shared secret)

**Phase 4 — mobile release:**
8. Release-candidate builds, signed store builds, one submission each
   (needs bundle-ID sign-off + store accounts)

**Phase 5 — cutover (the LAST phase; per DEPLOYMENT.md §3–5):**
9. Vercel deploy + env (needs Vercel access)
10. Content freeze; pause Base44 scheduled workflows
11. **Fresh full Base44 data export → media re-host → `import-base44.mjs`
    (dry-run, then real)** ← the data transfer deliberately happens here, at
    the end, so nothing drifts between copy and switch
12. Interpretations import from the second Base44 app
13. Spot-checks: founding cohort, tiers/Stripe IDs, chart counts; then
    `recalc-all-charts`
14. DNS cutover to Vercel (needs DNS access); production smoke pass
15. Launch flips: `GATING_ADMIN_ONLY` → false in BOTH `permissions.js` and
    `llm_tasks/core.ts`; declare `LAUNCH_DATE` in stamp-founding-member when
    Molly ends the founding window
16. Decommission Base44 (only after media + interpretations confirmed
    independent); delete orphaned V2 functions from the Supabase project
    (test-ephemeris, calculate-chart, generate-synthesis)

## Waiting on Molly (consolidated ask list)

| Item | Unblocks |
|---|---|
| GitHub collaborator invite (`silexdev`) | pushing all committed work (top priority) |
| Stripe team invite (Tony's email, Admin) | Phase 1.3 + Phase 3 |
| Astrology-API.io key (backend-only) | Phase 2 |
| Google OAuth client ID/secret → Supabase | Google sign-in |
| DNS access (or willingness to paste records) | Resend verification now; DNS cutover later |
| Vercel access (or new project under her account) | Phase 5 |
| Apple / Play / RevenueCat accounts + Apple shared secret + bundle-ID sign-off | Phases 3–4 |
| Sign-off: AI daily limits + tier-gate map | closes the LLM-tasks item |
| At cutover: fresh Base44 export + interpretations export + active-subscriber list | Phase 5 |
